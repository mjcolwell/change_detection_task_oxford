# Partial Report Change Detection Task (PERL - Oxford)

## Version 1.1 (16/02/2025)

**Change log**: Included task version 2 for PRE/POST designs. Made visual adjustments to improve visual clarity. Fixed minor issues with stimulus coding and duplicates. Upgraded to newer version of Psychopy. 

Task made by Michael Colwell (michael.colwell@psych.ox.ac.uk), with suggestions and improvements by Prof Catherine Harmer (catherine.harmer@psych.ox.ac.uk).

## Purpose of the task
This is an adaption of a classic task of visuo-spatial working memory, also known as a partial report change detection task. This task 
was created specifically to probe both location in space and colour (in a colour-blind friendly manner). Colours in the task
use a palette known as 'Color Universal Design (CUD)' created by Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito to allow colour discriminations across all
colour-blind populations.

This task is intended to be used in healthy individuals to probe visuo-spatial working memory across a parametric distribution. Thus, it would
provide an adequete measurement to investigate the cognitive effects of a psychopharmacologically active agent. The task is currently in use
in the PEACE study in Oxford (An fMRI investigation of the effects of selective histamine-3 receptor antagonism on cognitive and emotional processing in healthy individuals - https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05849675)

## Task specifications
The initial stimulus presentation lasts 300ms, followed by a short pseudo-random ISI (0.7-1.1s), then the set will reappear on the screen with
the colour of one stimulus having changed. Participants then must click on the changed square using the mouse, followed by another pseudo-random 
ISI (0.7-1.1s). Following the ISI, a colour wheel of eight colours will be presented; using the mouse participants must identify the original colour of the
changed (target) stimulus.

There are four main blocks throughout the experiment, with each block having a set number of stimuli per trial. The first block consists of three stimuli, the second
four, the third five and the final six. Participants undertake a tutorial/practice trial before taking part in the main task.

Stimuli will only appear onscreen in a 1:1 square, so that only central vision is required throughout. All stimuli are at least '0.1x0.1' units apart from each other,
with a pseudo-random location on an even grid pattern (0,0.1,0.2,0.3). No stimuli appear more than 0.3 units away from center-screen. No more than two stimuli appear
in each quadrant of the X,Y axes at any stage. Every stimulus in a set will always have a unique colour. Some stimulus colour changes have high contrast (e.g. yellow -> black),
while others are more subtle (e.g. blue -> sky blue). 

## Instructions
1. Download Psychopy (version v2021.2.3 and above) - https://www.psychopy.org/download.html
2. Once installed, unzip the contents of this folder to a location on your computer
3. Open the 'Colour Change Detection Task - Oxford PERL' folder and double click on 'Colour Change Detection Task Oxford PERL'.psyexp
5. Click 'run' experiment and enter sessional details (e.g., participant ID).
6. Press run and follow onscreen instructions
7. Once the experiment has ended, you will find your test data in the 'data' folder.

## Individual setup

Depending on your monitor, you will want to change the monitor settings in 'psychopy'. The default monitor is optimised for a small laptop monitor. 
Ideally, you want to change the monitor specifications (e.g. screen width) so that the grey centred box is only occupying 50% of vertical pixels. The purpose of this
is that a smaller box means all stimuli appear in central, not peripheral, vision.
